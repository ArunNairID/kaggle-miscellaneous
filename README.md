# Kaggle - Miscellaneous

"Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it." -- George Santayana

This is a compiled list of Kaggle competitions and their winning solutions for problems that don't fit well in regression, classification, sequence, or image regime. 

The purpose to complie this list is for easier access and therefore learning from the best in data science.

Literature review is a crucial yet sometimes overlooked part in data science. To avoid reinventing the wheels and get inspired on how to preprocess, engineer, and model the data, it's worth spend 1/10 to 1/5 of the project time just researching how people deal with similar problems/datasets.

Time spent on literature review is time well spent.

This is only one list of the whole compilation. For other lists of competitions and solutions, please refer to:

* Kaggle - [Regression](https://github.com/ShuaiW/kaggle-regression/)
* Kaggle - [Classification](https://github.com/ShuaiW/kaggle-classification/)
* Kaggle - [Sequence](https://github.com/ShuaiW/kaggle-sequence)
* Kaggle - [Image](https://github.com/ShuaiW/kaggle-image)

Hope the compilation can save you efforts and offer you insights. Enjoy!

# Kaggle - Miscellaneous

"Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it." -- George Santayana

This is a compiled list of Kaggle competitions and their winning solutions for problems that don't fit well in regression, classification, or deep learning regimes. 

The purpose to complie this list is for easier access and therefore learning from the best in data science.

Literature review is a crucial yet sometimes overlooked part in data science. To avoid reinventing the wheels and get inspired on how to preprocess, engineer, and model the data, it's worth spend 1/10 to 1/5 of the project time just researching how people deal with similar problems/datasets.

Time spent on literature review is time well spent.

This is only one list of the whole compilation. For other lists of competitions and solutions, please refer to:

* Kaggle - [Regression](https://github.com/ShuaiW/kaggle-regression/)
* Kaggle - [Classification](https://github.com/ShuaiW/kaggle-classification/)
* Kaggle - [Deep Learning](https://github.com/ShuaiW/kaggle-deeplearning)

Hope the compilation can save you efforts and offer you insights. Enjoy!

### [Semi-Supervised Feature Learning](https://www.kaggle.com/c/SemiSupervisedFeatureLearning)

Sat 24 Sep 2011 – Mon 17 Oct 2011

There's been a lot of recent work done in unsupervised feature learning for classification and there are a ton of older methods that also work well. The purpose of this competition is to find out which of these methods work best on relatively large-scale high dimensional learning tasks.
